Inline Formatting

I want to make sure I handle all inline formatting. I need to handle
*bold*, /italic/, =code=, ~verbatim~, _underline_, +strikethrough+. 

In addition, I need to make sure I can handle links. We've got simple
links, like this:

- [[http://www.bing.com]]
- [[http://www.google.com]]
- http://www.gmail.com

Note the last one *is not* a link, as the source doesn't include it in
double-brackets and I don't auto-recognize URLs.

I should also handle links with [[http://www.xkcd.com][helpful text]].

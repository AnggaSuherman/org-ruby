org-ruby version 0.5.0
    by Brian Dewey

== DESCRIPTION

This gem contains Ruby routines for parsing org-mode files.The most
significant thing this library does today is convert org-mode files to
HTML or textile. Currently, you cannot do much to customize the
conversion. The supplied textile conversion is optimized for
extracting "content" from the orgfile as opposed to "metadata." 

== CHANGES

* Parse (but not necessarily *use*) in-buffer settings. The following
  in-buffer settings *are* used:
  * Understand the #+TITLE: directive.
  * Exporting todo keywords (option todo:t)
  * Numbering headlines (option num:t)
  * Skipping text before the first headline (option skip:t)
  * Skipping tables (option |:nil)
  * Custom todo keywords
  * EXPORT_SELECT_TAGS and EXPORT_EXLUDE_TAGS for controlling parts of
    the tree to export
* Rewrite "file:(blah).org" links to "http:(blah).html" links. This
  makes the inter-links to other org-mode files work.
* Uses <th> tags inside table rows that precede table separators.
* Bugfixes:
  * Headings now have HTML escaped.

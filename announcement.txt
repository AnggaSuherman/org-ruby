org-ruby version 0.6.1
    by Brian Dewey

== DESCRIPTION

This gem contains Ruby routines for parsing org-mode files.The most
significant thing this library does today is convert org-mode files to
HTML or textile. Currently, you cannot do much to customize the
conversion. The supplied textile conversion is optimized for
extracting "content" from the orgfile as opposed to "metadata." 

== CHANGES
* Added encoding directive to support Ruby 1.9.2
* Headlines with the COMMENT keyword, and the PROPERTIES drawer are not exported
* Angle links in org-mode are embedded in anchor tags on html output
* #+BEGIN/END_SRC lang code blocks are embedded in code tags with class that specifies the coding language
* Fixed bug in code blocks when a colon was at the beginning
* More than five dashes create an horizontal rule in html output (thanks Neil-Smithline!)

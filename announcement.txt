org-ruby version 0.4.2

== DESCRIPTION

This gem contains Ruby routines for parsing org-mode files.The most
significant thing this library does today is convert org-mode files to
HTML or textile. Currently, you cannot do much to customize the
conversion. The supplied textile conversion is optimized for
extracting "content" from the orgfile as opposed to "metadata." 

== CHANGES

* Got rid of the extraneous newline at the start of code blocks.
* Everything now shows up in code blocks, even org-mode metadata.
* Fixed bugs:
  * Regressed smart double quotes with HTML escaping. Added a test
    case and fixed the regression.

== DESCRIPTION

This gem contains Ruby routines for parsing org-mode files.The most
significant thing this library does today is convert org-mode files to
HTML or textile. Currently, you cannot do much to customize the
conversion. The supplied textile conversion is optimized for
extracting "content" from the orgfile as opposed to "metadata." 

== CHANGES

* Added +to_html+ for HTML output
* Now supports the following inline markup: 
  * bold
  * italic
  * code
  * verbatim
  * underline
  * strikethrough
* Continued code cleanup and refactoring

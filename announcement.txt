orgmode_parser version 0.0.2
    by Brian Dewey
    http://bdewey.com

== DESCRIPTION

Helpful Ruby routines for parsing orgmode files. The most significant
thing this library does today is convert orgmode files to
textile. Currently, you cannot do much to customize the
conversion. The supplied textile conversion is optimized for
extracting "content" from the orgfile as opposed to "metadata."

== CHANGES

* Initial version. Handles tables (but not headers), headlines,
  paragraphs, block quotes, strong & emphasis formatting.

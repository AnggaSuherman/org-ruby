orgmode_parser version 0.1.0
    by Brian Dewey

== DESCRIPTION

Helpful Ruby routines for parsing orgmode files. The most significant
thing this library does today is convert orgmode files to
textile. Currently, you cannot do much to customize the
conversion. The supplied textile conversion is optimized for
extracting "content" from the orgfile as opposed to "metadata."

== CHANGES

* Added support for block code
* Added support for list items that wrap in the org source
* Major code cleanup:
  Added +OutputBuffer+ class that should make the code more maintainable.

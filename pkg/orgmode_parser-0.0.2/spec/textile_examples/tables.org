TABLES

Different types of ORG tables.

* Simple table, no header.

| Cell one   | Cell two  |
| Cell three | Cell four |


* Indented table

  | Cell one |
  | Cell two |

  And here's some paragraph content. The line breaks will need to get
  removed here, but not for the tables.

* Table with header

  | One   | Two   | Three |
  |-------+-------+-------|
  | Four  | Five  | Six   |
  | Seven | Eight | Nine  |

  The separator row should not get printed out.

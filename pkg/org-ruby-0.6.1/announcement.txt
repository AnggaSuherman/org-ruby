org-ruby version 0.6.0
    by Brian Dewey

== DESCRIPTION

This gem contains Ruby routines for parsing org-mode files.The most
significant thing this library does today is convert org-mode files to
HTML or textile. Currently, you cannot do much to customize the
conversion. The supplied textile conversion is optimized for
extracting "content" from the orgfile as opposed to "metadata." 

== CHANGES
* The anchor text for a link can now be an image, and will get an img tag (thanks, punchagan)
* Fixed bug in tables; only the first row is a header even if others have divider lines (thanks, leathekd)
* Fixed bug in the list regular expression; lists require a space after the item delimiter (thanks, punchagan)
* Lots from ruediger:
  * subscript / superscript
  * definition lists
  * centered text
  * symbol replacement

* Minor enhancement: Displays inline images
